# 🌐 NetPractice

**NetPractice** is a networking fundamentals project from the 42 curriculum. It challenges students to configure and troubleshoot simulated network topologies using a visual interface, helping to build a solid understanding of IP addressing, routing, and basic networking principles.

---

## 🧠 Concept

This project introduces students to networking concepts through a series of 10 levels. Each level presents a misconfigured network, and the goal is to make it functional by adjusting IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing where necessary.

---

## 🛠️ Features

### 🔹 Mandatory

- Work through **10 progressively challenging levels**.
- Each level presents a non-functional network topology with specific issues to solve.
- Fix routing tables, interfaces, and IP/subnet assignments.
- Validate the network configuration using the **Check again** button.
- Export configuration files for each level with the **Get my config** button.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Download the Interface

- Download the project archive from the **intra**.
- Extract it to a folder of your choice.

### 2. Open the Training Platform

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- You can either:
  - **Enter your login** to track your progress.
  - Or **leave it empty** to use correction/training mode.

### 3. Solve the Levels

- Read the goal description for each level.
- Adjust the values in the diagram to make the network functional.
- Use the logs at the bottom of the page to debug your setup.
- Once the level is solved, use the **Get my config** button to export the file.

## 🧪 Evaluation Tips

- You must complete **3 random levels** during your defense.
- **No external tools** are allowed during the evaluation (except a basic calculator like `bc`).
- Make sure to export your configs **with your login** filled in.

## 📖 Learning Outcomes

- Understand and apply IP addressing and subnetting.
- Configure routers and devices to build a functional network.
- Gain practical experience with diagnostic thinking in network setups.
